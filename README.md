# jean - AI-Powered Git Worktree TUI with Claude Code Support

A powerful, feature-rich terminal user interface for managing Git worktrees with integrated tmux session management, GitHub PR automation, AI-powered commit messages & branch naming, custom script execution, and seamless Claude Code integration. Built with [Bubble Tea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) and designed for developers who work with multiple feature branches simultaneously while leveraging AI to streamline their workflow.

> **Why "jean"?** Named after Jean-Claude Van Damme - combining "Jean" (the CLI) with "Claude" (AI integration). A perfect martial arts kick of productivity! 🥋

## Features

### Core Worktree Management
- **Full CRUD Operations**: Create, list, switch, and delete worktrees with single keystrokes
- **Organized Workspaces**: All worktrees created in `.workspaces/` directory with auto-generated names (`happy-panda-42`, `swift-dragon-17`, etc.)
- **Create from New or Existing Branches**: Choose to create a new branch (`n`) or attach to existing (`a`)
- **Session Persistence**: Detach and return to your work anytime - context persists across terminal restarts
- **Automatic Sorting**: Worktrees sorted by last modified time (most recent first)
- **Dual Session Mode**: Run both Claude AI and terminal sessions simultaneously on the same worktree

### AI-Powered Workflow
- **AI Commit Messages**: Automatically generate conventional commit messages from your changes using 11+ AI models (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, etc.)
- **AI Branch Naming**: Generate semantic branch names from code changes (e.g., `feat/user-authentication`, `fix/button-alignment`)
- **AI PR Content**: Auto-generate PR titles and descriptions from your git diff
- **OpenRouter Integration**: Switch between multiple AI models on the fly (GPT-4 Turbo, Claude 3 Opus, Gemini Pro, Llama 2, and more)
- **Configurable AI Settings**: Toggle AI features per repository, manage API keys securely

### GitHub PR Automation
- **Create Draft PRs**: Auto-commit, rename branches with AI, generate PR content, and create draft PRs in one command (`P`)
- **Create Worktree from PR**: Browse and filter GitHub PRs, create worktrees from PR branches instantly (`N`)
- **View PRs in Browser**: Open PR links with clickable terminal hyperlinks (`v`)
- **Merge with Strategy Selection**: Merge with squash, merge commit, or rebase options (`M`)
- **PR Status Tracking**: See PR status directly in the worktree details panel

### Git Operations
- **Smart Push**: Push to remote with auto-commit and AI-powered branch naming (`p`)
- **Refresh with Auto-Pull**: Fetch from remote and pull all worktrees in one command, skip branches with uncommitted changes (`r`)
- **Update from Base**: Pull/merge base branch changes into your worktree (`u`)
- **Branch Management**: Rename branches (`B`), checkout branches (`K`), change base branch (`b`)
- **Merge Conflict Handling**: Gracefully handle merge conflicts with abort option

### Custom Scripts & Automation
- **Custom Script Execution**: Define and run bash scripts from `jean.json` on any worktree (`R`, `;`)
- **Real-time Output Streaming**: Watch script execution with live output updates
- **Script Management**: View running scripts, kill scripts mid-execution, check status and elapsed time
- **Setup Automation**: Auto-execute setup scripts when creating new worktrees
- **Environment Variables**: Access `JEAN_WORKSPACE_PATH`, `JEAN_ROOT_PATH`, `JEAN_BRANCH` in your scripts

### UI & Customization
- **5 Built-in Themes**: Matrix, Coolify, Dracula, Nord, Solarized - choose your aesthetic
- **Dynamic Theme Switching**: Change themes without restarting the app
- **Intuitive Split-Panel UI**: Worktree list on left, detailed information and status on right

## Installation

### Quick Install (Recommended)

The easiest way to install jean - just run the installation script:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/coollabsio/jean/raw/main/install.sh | bash
```

Or if you prefer to review before running:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/coollabsio/jean/raw/main/install.sh -o install.sh
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

The installer will:
- Download the precompiled binary (or build from source if needed)
- Copy it to `/usr/local/bin/` (using sudo if necessary)
- Set up shell integration for automatic directory switching

### Using Go Install

If you have Go 1.21+ installed:

```bash
go install github.com/coollabsio/jean@latest
```

After installation, run `jean init` to set up shell integration.

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/coollabsio/jean
cd jean
go build -o jean
sudo mv jean /usr/local/bin/
jean init  # Set up shell integration
```

## Platform Support

### Supported Platforms

- **Linux** ✅ Full support
- **macOS** ✅ Full support
- **Windows** ⚠️ WSL2 required (see below)

### Windows Users

jean requires **WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux 2)** to run on Windows because it depends on:
- **tmux** - Terminal multiplexer (Unix/Linux only)
- **bash/zsh/fish** - POSIX shells (not available on native Windows)

**To use jean on Windows:**

1. Install WSL2: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install
2. Inside WSL2, install jean normally (see Installation section below)
3. Use jean from within your WSL2 terminal

If you try to run jean on native Windows (not WSL2), you'll see an error message with installation instructions for WSL2.

## Prerequisites

- **tmux**: Required for persistent session management
  ```bash
  # macOS
  brew install tmux

  # Ubuntu/Debian
  sudo apt install tmux

  # Arch
  sudo pacman -S tmux
  ```

## Shell Integration Setup

The shell wrapper enables:
1. Automatic tmux session creation/attachment
2. Claude CLI auto-start in each worktree
3. Session persistence (detach with `Ctrl+B D`, return anytime)

### Quick Setup (One Command)

Simply run:

```bash
jean init
```

This will:
- Auto-detect your shell (bash, zsh, fish)
- Install the wrapper to your shell configuration file
- Create a backup of your config file
- Provide instructions for activating the changes

After installation, restart your terminal or run:
```bash
source ~/.bashrc   # for bash
source ~/.zshrc    # for zsh
# or restart fish
```

### Updating the Installation

If you already have jean installed and want to update to the latest wrapper:

```bash
jean init --update
```

### Removing the Integration

To cleanly remove jean from your shell configuration:

```bash
jean init --remove
```

### Manual Installation (Optional)

If you prefer to set up the wrapper manually or have a shell not supported by `jean init`, you can view the wrapper functions embedded in `install/templates.go`:

- **BashZshWrapper** constant: Bash/Zsh shell wrapper
- **FishWrapper** constant: Fish shell wrapper

These templates are automatically compiled into the jean binary and deployed by `jean init`.

## Usage

### Basic Usage

Run `jean` in any Git repository:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/repo
jean
```

### With Custom Path (for Development)

Test on a different repository without navigating to it:

```bash
jean -path /path/to/other/repo
```

## Advanced Features

### AI-Powered Workflow

**Automatic Commit Messages**:
```
Press 'c' to commit with AI-generated messages:
1. AI analyzes your git diff
2. Generates conventional commit message (feat/fix/docs/etc.)
3. You review and can edit before committing
4. Commit is created with generated message

Supports 11+ AI models (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, Llama, etc.)
```

**Semantic Branch Naming**:
```
When creating PRs or pushing:
1. AI analyzes your code changes
2. Generates meaningful branch names (feat/fix/refactor/etc.)
3. Replaces random names with semantic convention
4. Can be toggled on/off in AI Settings
```

### GitHub PR Workflow (Single Command)

```
Press 'P' to:
1. Auto-commit any uncommitted changes
2. Rename branch with AI (optional)
3. Generate PR title/description with AI (optional)
4. Push to remote
5. Create draft PR
6. Store PR URL for future reference

Everything in one keystroke!
```

### Custom Scripts System

Define scripts in `jean.json`:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "run": "npm start",
    "test": "npm test",
    "build": "npm run build",
    "deploy": "npm run build && ./deploy.sh"
  }
}
```

Run with `R` (quick 'run' script) or `;` (scripts menu) with:
- Real-time output streaming
- Script execution status and elapsed time
- Kill running scripts mid-execution
- Setup scripts run automatically on worktree creation

### Multi-Model AI Integration

Switch between AI models per repository:
- OpenAI: GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-4, GPT-3.5
- Anthropic: Claude 3 Opus, Sonnet, Haiku
- Google: Gemini Pro
- Meta: Llama 2
- Mistral: Mistral 7B
- And more via OpenRouter API

API keys stored securely in local config (`~/.config/jean/config.json`).

## How It Works

All worktrees are created inside a `.workspaces/` directory in your repository root with randomly generated names like:
- `happy-panda-42`
- `swift-dragon-17`
- `brave-falcon-89`

This keeps your workspace organized and makes it easy to manage multiple feature branches without cluttering your file system.

## Tmux Sessions & Claude CLI

When you switch to a worktree, `jean` creates separate sessions for different purposes:

1. **Claude sessions** (`Enter` key): Named `jean-<branch-name>`, includes Claude CLI
2. **Terminal sessions** (`t` key): Named `jean-<branch-name>-terminal`, shell only
3. **Both sessions can coexist** for the same worktree
4. **Persists your work** - detach anytime with `Ctrl+B D`

You can have both a Claude session and a terminal session open for the same worktree and switch between them as needed.

### Session Management

**View all sessions**: Press `S` (Shift+S) in the TUI to see active sessions

**Switching between sessions**:
1. Open a terminal session with `t` (creates `jean-<branch>-terminal`)
2. Work in the terminal, then press `Ctrl+B D` to detach
3. You'll automatically return to jean
4. Press `Enter` to open the Claude session (creates `jean-<branch>`)
5. Now you have both sessions running simultaneously
6. You can continue detaching and switching between sessions

**Manual session control**:
```bash
# List all jean sessions
tmux ls | grep jean-

# Attach to a specific Claude session
tmux attach -t jean-feature-auth

# Attach to a specific terminal session
tmux attach -t jean-feature-auth-terminal

# Kill a session
tmux kill-session -t jean-feature-auth
# or
tmux kill-session -t jean-feature-auth-terminal
```

**Detach from session**: `Ctrl+B D` (tmux default)

**Disable auto-Claude**: Use the `--no-claude` flag
```bash
jean --no-claude
```

### How Sessions Work

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  You: jean (select "feature-auth")                          │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Press Enter → Claude session "jean-feature-auth"           │
│  ├─ Exists? → Attach to existing Claude session            │
│  └─ New? → Create session + start Claude CLI               │
│                                                              │
│  Press t → Terminal session "jean-feature-auth-terminal"   │
│  ├─ Exists? → Attach to existing terminal session          │
│  └─ New? → Create session with shell only                  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Benefits**:
- Each worktree can have TWO separate sessions (Claude + terminal)
- Work persists across terminal restarts
- Context is maintained per branch
- Easy to switch between multiple features
- Flexibility to use Claude or terminal as needed

- **Manual edit**: The config is marked with unique identifiers - you can manually delete it anytime

**Important notes:**
- Your existing `~/.tmux.conf` settings are preserved
- Changes apply to new tmux sessions only (existing sessions are unaffected)
- The config section has warning markers - don't modify them as they're used for updates
- You can safely delete the entire marked section if you no longer want it

#### Detailed Configuration Breakdown

The opinionated tmux configuration is organized into several categories for a comprehensive terminal experience:

**Mouse & Scrolling:**
```tmux
set -g mouse on                                    # Enable mouse for all operations
bind -n WheelUpPane if-shell ...                   # Custom wheel scrolling in copy mode
set -g terminal-overrides 'xterm*:smcup@:rmcup@'   # Make scrolling work like normal terminal
set -g allow-passthrough on                        # Enable passthrough for modern features
set -ga terminal-features "*:hyperlinks"           # Clickable URLs and filesystem paths
```

**History & Buffer:**
```tmux
set -g history-limit 10000    # 10,000 lines of scrollback (default is usually 2,000)
```

**Colors & Terminal:**
```tmux
set -g default-terminal "screen-256color"          # Enable 256 color support
set -ga terminal-overrides ",xterm-256color:Tc"    # True color (24-bit) support
set -g focus-events on                             # Enable focus events for vim/neovim
```

**Window Management:**
```tmux
set -g base-index 1              # Start window numbering at 1 (not 0)
set -g pane-base-index 1         # Start pane numbering at 1
set -g renumber-windows on       # Automatically renumber windows when one is closed
```

**Keybindings:**
```tmux
bind-key -n C-d detach-client    # Ctrl+D to detach (quick escape)
bind-key -n S-Right next-window  # Shift+Right arrow for next window
bind-key -n S-Left previous-window  # Shift+Left arrow for previous window
```
*Note: Shift+Arrow navigation prevents conflicts with terminal readline shortcuts (Ctrl+Arrow for word jumping)*

**Visual Styling:**
```tmux
# Status bar with repo:branch format
set -g status-left "#[fg=green]jean@#[fg=cyan]#(echo '#S' | sed 's/^jean-\\([^-]*\\)-\\(.*\\)/\\1:\\2/') "
set -g status-right "#[fg=yellow]%H:%M #[fg=white]%d-%b-%y"

# Pane borders (subtle inactive, bright active)
set -g pane-border-style fg=colour238           # Gray for inactive panes
set -g pane-active-border-style fg=colour33     # Blue for active pane

# Message styling (used for tmux command feedback)
set -g message-style bg=colour33,fg=black,bold  # Blue background, bold text
```

**Why these settings?**
- **Mouse support** makes tmux more accessible and intuitive for modern workflows
- **Large scrollback** helps when reviewing logs, test output, or long command results
- **True color** ensures your terminal theme and syntax highlighting looks perfect
- **Shift+Arrow navigation** is faster than the default `Ctrl+B n/p` and doesn't conflict with shell shortcuts
- **Quick detach with Ctrl+D** saves keystrokes compared to `Ctrl+B D`
- **Window numbering from 1** makes it easier to jump to windows (Ctrl+B 1, Ctrl+B 2, etc.)
- **Focus events** let vim/neovim know when you switch panes, enabling better autoread behavior
- **Clickable links** let you Cmd+Click (macOS) or Ctrl+Click (Linux) URLs in the terminal

The full configuration is embedded in the jean binary and can be viewed in [`session/tmux.go`](./session/tmux.go) (lines 199-256).

### Themes

   - Scientific color palette

**How to Change Theme**:
1. Press `s` to open settings
2. Navigate to "Theme" and press `Enter`
3. Use `↑`/`↓` to preview themes
4. Press `Enter` to apply
5. Theme changes instantly without restart
6. Your preference is saved automatically

### Base Branch

The base branch is used when creating new worktrees with new branches. jean automatically determines the base branch:

1. Check saved config for repository
2. Fall back to current branch
3. Fall back to default branch (main/master)
4. Fall back to empty string (user must set manually)

You can change the base branch at any time by pressing `b` in the main view.

### Editor Integration

jean includes built-in editor integration for opening worktrees in your IDE with a single keypress.

**Setting your preferred editor:**
1. Press `e` in the main view (or access via settings menu with `s`)
2. Use `↑`/`↓` or `j`/`k` to navigate through available editors
3. Press `Enter` to select and save your preference

**Available editors:**
- `code` - VS Code (default)
- `cursor` - Cursor IDE
- `nvim` - Neovim
- `vim` - Vim
- `subl` - Sublime Text
- `atom` - Atom
- `zed` - Zed

**Opening a worktree:**
- Navigate to any worktree in the list
- Press `o` to open it in your configured editor
- The editor launches in the background and you stay in jean
- Editor preference is saved per repository in `~/.config/jean/config.json`

**Tips:**
- If opening fails, press `e` to select a different editor
- Each repository can have its own editor preference
- The editor command must be in your PATH

### Key Architectural Patterns

**Bubble Tea MVC**: The TUI follows the Elm Architecture pattern via Bubble Tea:
- **Model**: Holds all application state (worktrees, branches, sessions, UI state, modals)
- **Update**: Handles messages (keyboard input, async operation results)
- **View**: Renders the UI based on current model state

**Async Operations**: Git and tmux operations are wrapped in Tea commands:
- Operations run asynchronously and return typed messages
- Results are handled in the Update function to update state
- Examples: `worktreesLoadedMsg`, `worktreeCreatedMsg`, `branchRenamedMsg`

**Modal System**: The TUI uses a modal system for different operations:
- Create worktree, delete confirmation, branch selection, session list, rename branch, change base branch
- All modals support Tab navigation, Enter to confirm, Esc to cancel

**Shell Integration Protocol**: Communication with shell wrappers via:
- `JEAN_SWITCH_FILE` environment variable (preferred): Write switch data to file
- Stdout (legacy): Print switch data in format `path|branch|auto-claude|terminal-only`

**Worktree Organization**: All worktrees are created in `.workspaces/` directory at repository root with randomly generated names (adjective-noun-number pattern)
